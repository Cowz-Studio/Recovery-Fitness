# Getting started
Make sure to install mongodb locally or connect to it. 
You will need to create an .env file in apps/site-backend, following the .env.example.
Note that you should be able to find your URI when you install and run your local mongodb instance.
Your PAYLOAD_SECRET is your password. It can be anything you'd like it to be.
