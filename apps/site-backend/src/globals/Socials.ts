/**
 * This needs information for connecting Sam's socials. 
 * Integration unknown so will need to come back for this one.
 *    An initial cursory look suggests we could use Instagram Basic Display API
 * At the minimum, Sam will need to be able to switch instagram 
 * accounts/handles should he want to change accounts/rebrand.
 * Could probably have handles and add/remove socials like FB, IG.
 * For now we will:
 * 1. Let him hardcode in socials - a handle and an image
 *    Then, we will see how we can integrate that with a 'preview' experience
